VIVO-ISF Data Standard
------

This repository is an organization-wide wiki, issue tracker, and later a VIVO-ISF website as Github Pages. Github does not provide such functionality and this repository is an attempt to workaround this limitation.

Issue tracker
------

Please use the issue tracker for this repository for starting any issue related to the VIVO-ISF Data Standard. Unless your issues is directly related to one of the other repositories, and it doesn't need community input or discussion, your issue should start as an issue in this GitHub repository. It can then continue in one of the other repositories as needed. The reason for doing this is to minimize what the general community needs to track here on GitHub, and to limit the exposure to more lower-level discussions that usually occur in the other repositories.

Wiki
----

Please feel free to contribute to the wiki. There are various VIVO-ISF related resources on-line. Some of them will gradually migrate to this wiki but others will be linked to from one of the wiki pages.
